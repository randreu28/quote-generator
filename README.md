# Quote generator

This is a Quote generator using the [Deno KV](https://deno.com/kv), as part of
the [Deno KV Hackaton](https://deno.com/blog/deno-kv-hackathon). Feel free to
check it out!

## Usage

To start the project, you'll need installed the
[Deno CLI](https://deno.com/manual@v1.34.2/getting_started/installation):

The project uses the [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) framework and the
[Deno](https://deno.com/runtime) runtime.

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary. Notice that this
runs with the `--unstable` flag, which allows us to use the (currently on beta)
KV deno database.
